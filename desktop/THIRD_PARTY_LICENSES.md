# Third-Party Software & Licenses — WiFi Audio Streaming (Desktop)

This application is licensed under the **EUPL v1.2** (see `LICENSE.md`).
It bundles and uses the third-party open-source components listed below. Each
remains the property of its respective authors and is distributed under its own
licence. We are grateful to all of these projects.

> **WFAS v2 protocol (MIT):** the WiFi Audio Streaming wire protocol is this
> project's own. A C reference implementation is published separately under the
> **MIT License** (Copyright © 2026 Marco Morosi,
> <https://github.com/marcomorosi06/wfas-protocol>) so anyone can adopt WFAS v2 freely,
> e.g. on microcontrollers. It is not bundled in this app.

> ⚠️ **FFmpeg (LGPL) — important:** see the dedicated section below. FFmpeg is
> distributed under the GNU LGPL v2.1 or later (some optional components may be
> under the GPL). Its source code and the build scripts are publicly available
> as required by that licence.

## FFmpeg (LGPL v2.1 or later)

This application uses **FFmpeg** (https://ffmpeg.org) for AAC/Opus audio
encoding in the optional HTTP streaming server and, in the legacy capture path,
for audio grabbing. The FFmpeg native libraries are **not** modified by us; they
are obtained, unchanged, from the **JavaCPP Presets** project
(https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets) and loaded dynamically at runtime
as separate shared libraries (`avcodec`, `avformat`, `avutil`, …).

FFmpeg is free software licensed under the **GNU Lesser General Public License
(LGPL) version 2.1 or later**. Depending on how the binaries were configured,
some optional FFmpeg components may be licensed under the **GNU General Public
License (GPL)**.

In accordance with the LGPL:

* **Copyright:** © the FFmpeg developers. FFmpeg is a trademark of Fabrice
  Bellard, originator of the FFmpeg project.
* **Source code:** the complete corresponding source of FFmpeg is available at
  <https://ffmpeg.org/download.html>, and the exact build configuration and
  scripts used to produce the bundled binaries are available from the JavaCPP
  Presets project at <https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets/tree/master/ffmpeg>.
* **A copy of the LGPL v2.1** is provided at <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html>
  (and the GPL at <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html>).
* **Relinking (LGPL §6):** because FFmpeg is shipped as separate, dynamically
  loaded shared libraries, users may replace them with their own (compatible)
  build of FFmpeg.

> 🔧 **Maintainer action — verify the exact FFmpeg licence of the shipped build.**
> The JavaCPP Presets FFmpeg binaries may be built either as pure LGPL or with
> GPL components enabled (e.g. x264/x265). If GPL components are included, the
> combined distribution must be under a GPL-compatible licence — EUPL v1.2 is
> one-way compatible with the GPL, but you should confirm this consciously.
> You can check the actual licence at runtime via JavaCV:
> `org.bytedeco.ffmpeg.global.avutil.avutil_license()` (returns e.g.
> `"LGPL version 2.1 or later"` or `"GPL version 2 or later"`), and the build
> options via `org.bytedeco.ffmpeg.global.avutil.av_version_info()`. Record the
> result here once verified.

  dependency: the project supplies its own `LuminanceSource`, so no AWT-only
  ZXing code is shipped.
